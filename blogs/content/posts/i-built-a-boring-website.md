# I Built a Boring Website

I built [QuietFeeds](https://quietfeeds.com/), and it's boring. It aggregates links from various RSS feeds and displays them in a somewhat likable way. I knew it would be boring, yet I built it.

Why would anyone invest their time into building such an unremarkable website? That’s what this post is about — my justification for building something intentionally boring.


## Why I Built It

**TLDR** : I quit social media, needed a calm way to keep up with topics I genuinely care about, and found myself manually checking Hacker News and other sources. So I built [QuietFeeds](https://quietfeeds.com/) — a simple site that pulls relevant articles from my chosen sources and shows me only what I care about.

I realised that I'm hooked to social media. First, I deleted Instagram — despite knowing the psychology and algorithms behind the engagement trap, I still got caught in it. Then it was Reddit. I loved the communities, the conversations, and the endless stream of knowledge and opinions. But it was the same story — hours gone, little gained.

I still visit Reddit occasionally via desktop if I'm searching for opinions, but I rarely participate. Now, I was only using YouTube and WhatsApp. WhatsApp isn't a problem for me — I use it to stay in touch with close friends and family. YouTube, though? Tricky.

I’ve learned a lot from YouTube. Tech talks, tutorials, updates from favorite creators — it felt productive. But most of the time, it was entertainment disguised as "education". It started to feel like I was being tricked into thinking I was learning, when really I was just... watching.

Then it hit me: was I pursuing what actually interests me — like software engineering or electronics — or just reacting to what was algorithmically fed to me?

So I quit YouTube too. (Mostly.)

Then came LinkedIn. It’s still useful in some ways, but I realized it was becoming yet another platform chasing attention. Maybe it was me, or maybe it was the people I followed — sharing updates to chase engagement and metrics. Either way, it started consuming more of my time than it was worth. Now, I only check it once a week for messages and nothing more.

After all that, I had a problem: I wanted a way to stay updated on things I care about — tech, engineering — without the manipulation. So I built [QuietFeeds](https://quietfeeds.com/).

## What QuietFeeds Does

- Aggregates latest links from handpicked RSS feeds
- Lets you add your interests as keywords
- Shows you articles relevant to those interests sorted by published time

## What QuietFeeds Doesn’t Do

- No reminders, notifications, or nudges to "come back"
- No "trending" tab, no engagement metrics
- No dark patterns, no addictive suggestions
- No time-wasting algorithms — just your interests

## Who Should Use It?

- People who want to read more, but hate being manipulated into it
- Those who quit (or want to quit) social media and still want to keep up with tech/news
- People who like boring, quiet tools that respect their time and attention

## Who Should Not Use It?

- If you want dopamine hits, viral videos, or endless scrolling — this isn't it
- If you rely on being constantly told what to click next — this won’t help
- If you prefer algorithmic or AI curation over control — look elsewhere

## Final Thoughts

QuietFeeds isn’t meant to change the world. It’s not innovative or flashy. It’s a tool I needed — a calm space on the internet. It’s boring by design. And that’s exactly the point.
