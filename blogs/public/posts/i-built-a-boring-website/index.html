<meta name="description" content="I Built a Boring Website
I built QuietFeeds, and it&rsquo;s boring. It aggregates links from various RSS feeds and displays them in a somewhat likable way. I knew it would be boring, yet I built it.
Why would anyone invest their time into building such an unremarkable website? That’s what this post is about — my justification for building something intentionally boring.
Why I Built It
TLDR : I quit social media, needed a calm way to keep up with topics I genuinely care about, and found myself manually checking Hacker News and other sources. So I built QuietFeeds — a simple site that pulls relevant articles from my chosen sources and shows me only what I care about." />

<p>I built <a href="https://quietfeeds.com/">QuietFeeds</a>, and it&rsquo;s boring. It aggregates links from various RSS feeds and displays them in a somewhat likable way. I knew it would be boring, yet I built it.</p>
<p>Why would anyone invest their time into building such an unremarkable website? That’s what this post is about — my justification for building something intentionally boring.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-built-it">Why I Built It</h2>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> : I quit social media, needed a calm way to keep up with topics I genuinely care about, and found myself manually checking Hacker News and other sources. So I built <a href="https://quietfeeds.com/">QuietFeeds</a> — a simple site that pulls relevant articles from my chosen sources and shows me only what I care about.</p>
<hr>
<p>I realised that I&rsquo;m hooked to social media. First, I deleted Instagram — despite knowing the psychology and algorithms behind the engagement trap, I still got caught in it. Then it was Reddit. I loved the communities, the conversations, and the endless stream of knowledge and opinions. But it was the same story — hours gone, little gained.</p>
<p>I still visit Reddit occasionally via desktop if I&rsquo;m searching for opinions, but I rarely participate. Now, I was only using YouTube and WhatsApp. WhatsApp isn&rsquo;t a problem for me — I use it to stay in touch with close friends and family. YouTube, though? Tricky.</p>
<p>I’ve learned a lot from YouTube. Tech talks, tutorials, updates from favorite creators — it felt productive. But most of the time, it was entertainment disguised as &ldquo;education&rdquo;. It started to feel like I was being tricked into thinking I was learning, when really I was just&hellip; watching.</p>
<p>Then it hit me: was I pursuing what actually interests me — like software engineering or electronics — or just reacting to what was algorithmically fed to me?</p>
<p>So I quit YouTube too. (Mostly.)</p>
<p>Then came LinkedIn. It’s still useful in some ways, but I realized it was becoming yet another platform chasing attention. Maybe it was me, or maybe it was the people I followed — sharing updates to chase engagement and metrics. Either way, it started consuming more of my time than it was worth. Now, I only check it once a week for messages and nothing more.</p>
<p>After all that, I had a problem: I wanted a way to stay updated on things I care about — tech, engineering — without the manipulation. So I built <a href="https://quietfeeds.com/">QuietFeeds</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-quietfeeds-does">What QuietFeeds Does</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aggregates latest links from handpicked RSS feeds</li>
<li>Lets you add your interests as keywords</li>
<li>Shows you articles relevant to those interests sorted by published time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-quietfeeds-doesnt-do">What QuietFeeds Doesn’t Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>No reminders, notifications, or nudges to &ldquo;come back&rdquo;</li>
<li>No &ldquo;trending&rdquo; tab, no engagement metrics</li>
<li>No dark patterns, no addictive suggestions</li>
<li>No time-wasting algorithms — just your interests</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-should-use-it">Who Should Use It?</h2>
<ul>
<li>People who want to read more, but hate being manipulated into it</li>
<li>Those who quit (or want to quit) social media and still want to keep up with tech/news</li>
<li>People who like boring, quiet tools that respect their time and attention</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-should-not-use-it">Who Should Not Use It?</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want dopamine hits, viral videos, or endless scrolling — this isn&rsquo;t it</li>
<li>If you rely on being constantly told what to click next — this won’t help</li>
<li>If you prefer algorithmic or AI curation over control — look elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>QuietFeeds isn’t meant to change the world. It’s not innovative or flashy. It’s a tool I needed — a calm space on the internet. It’s boring by design. And that’s exactly the point.</p>
<p>If you’re curious (or just bored enough), <a href="https://quietfeeds.com/">check it out</a>.</p>
